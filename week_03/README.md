I found this website interesting because it prides itself on allowing you to develop or build a website without the use of any code.

It appears to be doing that well, and when I disable javacscript and CSS the page is still fairly easy to read and you can see the hierarchy of the page visibly.  When you scroll down the site, you get the full story and your not overwhelmed by a ton of broken images or images split into 5 separate blocks (see AOL.com without CSS enabled…)  After viewing close to 50 websites with their style sheets and javaScript turned off this was the most impressive, outside of craigslist.org, that I saw.

I feel like if a single layer of the stack were to break, this site would be easy to update and wouldn’t cause a catastrophic failure.  This is nice because the content on the site, and the structure of its base are solid making me believe it could be a pretty solid product.
